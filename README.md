# Graph Cost Calculator and Grapg Display

## Overview

The Graph Cost Calculator is a Java-based application designed to handle user inputs for graph-related data. It allows users to enter and manage costs between indexes, display these costs, and interact with draggable labels. This project demonstrates basic input handling, 2D array manipulation, and recursive user interaction.

## Features

- **Input Collection**: Collects and validates user inputs for graph indexes and their associated costs.
- **Cost Display**: Displays the costs between each pair of indexes in a readable format.
- **Draggable Labels**: Provides functionality for draggable labels, which can be used for graphical representations or user interface enhancements.
- **User Confirmation**: Allows users to confirm if they want to input another set of values or exit the program.
